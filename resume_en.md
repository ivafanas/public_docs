### Experience

##### [Align Technology](https://aligntech.com)

**Senior C++ developer**  
*10.2018 - …*  
C++, python, analytic geometry

Medical CAD system development.

Help with completion and support for missing teeth positions prediction
algorithm: implemented several features (sticking out roots fixing,
smooth root scaling, predictions-based jaw arch computation) and
performance improvements.

Participation in long-time feasibility investigation of machine-learning
prediction of boundary between gingiva and tooth. Proposed and implemented
ML results post-processing algorithm. Algorithm is based on KNITRO
implementation of gradient descent method. Implemented improvements for
teeth-gingiva boundary construction algorithm which increased overall success
rate from 95% to 97% in teeth.

Performance guard role: tracking regressions, make regression analysis, propose
and plan improvements etc.

Standard helper role: help 3 other teams to complete their running late features
to be completed on date. It was required to adapt for the new team fast, clarify
their requirements and provide solution on time.

Buddy for new hire developers.
