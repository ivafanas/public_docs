Medical CAD system development.

Help with completion and support for missing teeth positions prediction
algorithm: implemented several features (sticking out roots fixing,
smooth root scaling, predictions-based jaw arch computation) and
performance improvements.

Participation in long-time feasibility investigation of machine-learning
prediction of boundary between gingiva and tooth. Proposed and implemented
ML results post-processing algorithm. Algorithm is based on KNITRO
implementation of gradient descent method.

Performance guard role: tracking regressions, make regression analysis, propose
and plan improvements etc.

Standard helper role: help 3 other teams to complete their running late features
to be completed on date. It was required to adapt fast for the new team, clarify
requirements and provide solution on time.
